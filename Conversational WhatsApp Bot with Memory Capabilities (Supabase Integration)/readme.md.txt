💬 Conversational WhatsApp Bot with Memory Capabilities (Supabase Integration)
This powerful n8n workflow turns WhatsApp into a conversational AI assistant that remembers past interactions using Supabase as a memory layer. It leverages OpenAI for natural dialogue and stores every message for long-term contextual understanding.

📌 Features
✅ Real-time WhatsApp conversations
✅ Memory-aware AI responses (chat history retention)
✅ Supabase integration for message storage and recall
✅ Built using n8n and OpenAI's Chat Model

🔄 How It Works – Step by Step
1. ⚡ WhatsApp Trigger
The workflow starts when a user sends a message via WhatsApp (Twilio/Meta API).

2. 📚 Get Memory (Supabase)
It fetches previous chat history from Supabase for that specific user (based on phone number or unique ID).

3. 🧠 Aggregate Context
All previous messages are aggregated into a single context block to simulate memory. This forms the base for the AI to understand past conversations.

4. 🤖 Generate AI Reply
The OpenAI Chat Model is used to generate a smart, context-aware response using:

Current message

Aggregated history from Supabase

5. 💾 Save New Message
The latest message (user and AI reply) is stored in Supabase to maintain continuity for future chats.

6. 📤 Send WhatsApp Reply
The AI’s reply is instantly sent back to the user via WhatsApp, completing the loop.
