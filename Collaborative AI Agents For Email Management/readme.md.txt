📬 Collaborative AI Agents for Email Management
This automation system offers fully AI-driven email triage and response management. It classifies incoming emails, routes them to the correct AI agent, and drafts high-quality, context-aware replies.

🧠 What This System Does
✅ 1. Intelligent Email Classification
Automatically detects and categorizes incoming emails into:

Support

Meeting Requests

Client Inquiries

Follow-Ups

✅ 2. Specialized AI Agents
Each type of email is routed to a dedicated agent, ensuring accurate and timely responses:

Support Agent: Troubleshooting, complaint handling, issue resolution

Meeting Agent: Schedules meetings and syncs with Google Calendar

Client Inquiry Agent: Responds to business inquiries and provides product/service info

Follow-Up Agent: Sends polite reminders for unresponded threads

✅ 3. Drafts Instead of Direct Sends
AI-generated replies are saved as Gmail drafts for:

Optional manual review

Scheduled or automated sending (based on your preferences)

⚙️ Tech Stack
Tool	Purpose
n8n	Workflow automation engine
Gmail API	Triggers, fetches emails, and drafts
Google Calendar API	Schedules meetings and syncs availability
OpenAI	Generates natural language responses
DeepSeek R1 / LLama Node (optional)	Local AI model for classification

🛠 Setup Guide
Step 1: Prerequisites
n8n instance (Cloud or Self-hosted)

Gmail account with API access

Google Calendar linked to the same account

OpenAI API key

Step 2: Installation
Download the Email AI Agents workflow template

Import into your n8n instance

Set up credentials:

Gmail OAuth

Google Calendar API

OpenAI API key

Step 3: Customize Behavior
Modify prompts per agent (for tone, length, or response type)

Adjust filters and conditions (for classification confidence)

Configure draft approval settings

Step 4: (Optional) Run Locally with LLama / DeepSeek R1
Swap OpenAI classifier with a local model

Use LLama Node integration (coming soon)

Keep classification logic local to reduce API costs

💡 Example Use Case
Scenario	AI Agent	Example Action
“I need help logging in”	Support Agent	Troubleshooting email with reset instructions
“Can we meet next week?”	Meeting Agent	Suggests time slots, creates calendar invite
“Tell me more about your pricing”	Client Inquiry Agent	Sends a tailored product pitch
“Just checking in...”	Follow-Up Agent	Sends a gentle reminder with a response prompt

🧠 Smart Features
Contextual Parsing: Understands the tone, urgency, and nature of the email

Structured Output: Uses JSON format for precise draft building

Adaptable: Add more categories (e.g., HR, Legal) by cloning and training new agents

Privacy-First: Classifier agent can run locally

🔒 Privacy & Cost Optimization
🔐 Local Classification using DeepSeek R1 or LLama ensures email data never leaves your system.

💸 Reduce OpenAI calls by only using OpenAI for content generation, not classification.
