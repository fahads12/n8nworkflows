🚀 The Ultimate LinkedIn Automation Built with n8n
This end-to-end automation flow creates, optimizes, and publishes LinkedIn posts using AI — entirely hands-free. Built in n8n, it leverages OpenAI, Google Sheets, and smart web scraping to transform a single keyword into fully published, engaging LinkedIn content with AI-generated visuals.

✅ What It Does – Step by Step
1. 💬 Input a Keyword via Chat
Trigger the workflow by sending a keyword (e.g., "AI Agent") through chat.

2. 🔍 Perform Keyword Research
An HTTP request fetches ~10 trending search queries based on the input.

These keywords are then used to generate variations of content.

3. 🔁 Loop Through Keywords
For each of the 10 keywords:

📝 Generates a LinkedIn post description

🧠 Creates a compelling title

🎨 Crafts an AI-ready image prompt

All outputs are stored in Google Sheets for reuse or review.

🧠 Smart Content Selection
Once the loop finishes:

An AI agent searches the web for trends

Picks the best performing keyword + post combo

Validates the content using a Think node

🖼️ AI Image Generation
The best prompt is used to:

Generate a relevant image via an image model

Convert to proper format

Retrieve the image URL

Run a quality check (resolution, size, text cutoff)

🧪 Pre-Publish Quality Control
Before publishing:

Image quality and layout are validated

Ensures the content is professional and publish-ready

📢 Auto-Publish to LinkedIn
If content passes validation:

Combines the title and description

Publishes it directly to LinkedIn using a POST API call

📊 Save and Track Data
Finally:

The published keyword, post content, and image URL are saved to Google Sheets

Prevents duplication and helps you reuse unused content in the future
