🤖 End-to-End Client Onboarding Automation (n8n Workflow)
This workflow automates your entire new client onboarding process — from sending a professional welcome email to saving client data into Google Sheets — triggered instantly upon form submission. It’s ideal for businesses, freelancers, and sales teams looking to automate lead follow-ups.

🔄 Overview of Workflow
The workflow is divided into two key automations triggered by a single form submission:

📩 1. Composing & Sending Formal Email to New Clients
Steps:
Trigger on Form Submission

The automation starts as soon as a user fills out a client onboarding form.

AI-Powered Email Drafting

An OpenAI chat model (AI Agent) processes the form input and composes a formal, personalized welcome email.

Email Finalization

OpenAI’s Message Model structures and refines the draft for clarity, tone, and professionalism.

Send Email

The finalized email is sent to the new client using Gmail (or any connected mail node).

🧾 2. Saving Leads to Google Sheets
Steps:
Process Lead Details with AI

Another AI Agent formats the client info (name, email, company, etc.) for proper sheet entry.

Refine with OpenAI

OpenAI Message Model ensures clean formatting (e.g., lowercase emails, title-cased names).

Append to Sheet

The new client data is added to a Google Sheet for future tracking, segmentation, or CRM import.
